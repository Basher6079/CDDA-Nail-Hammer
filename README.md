Suggested by u/k1llerk1ng

# Update
Now has three different ammo types: .50cal, .308cal, and 7.62mm.

These are high damage high AP, medium damage low AP, and low damage medium AP, respectively.

For better balance, the hammer itself imparts 50 damage, 10 AP and nails impart the damage of the orignal round.

These rounds are loud, so make sure you have hearing protection!
